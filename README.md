# LTSM_Product

How to run:

## Run 'test_data_synthesizer.py'

This generates some test data for the model. You can repace this with your real data later. 

## Run 'build_model.py'

This will build a model and output it to model.h5. It will run 2 examples after the model is complete

## Run 'run_model.py'

This will run the model you built earlier. I separated out so you can play with the model knowing you won't disrupt any of the code that builds the model.
